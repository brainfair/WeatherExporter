===============
## What is it? ##
WeatherExporter get current weather from OpenWeatherMap and export them to metrics endpoint in prometheus format

## Example Deployment ##
### Terraform
For Deploy we create Azure VM with same specifications. 
Configuration for create Azure VM providet in [terraform](terraform) folder

### Ansible
For configure VM and create service we use ansible role in [roles/weatherserver](roles/weatherserver)

### Docker-compose
For start service we use docker-compose file [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)
Docker-compose contains services:
- prometheus for collect metrics
- grafana for display metrics (with dashboards provision)
- weatherexporter for retrive temperature and export metrics
- traefik for reverse proxy to grafana with acme generated ssl certificate

### CI/CD
There are 3 workflow:
- [Check docker-compose file and check service can start](https://github.com/brainfair/WeatherExporter/actions/workflows/compose.yml) 
- [Apply Terraform script and create VM in Azure](https://github.com/brainfair/WeatherExporter/actions/workflows/terraform.yml)
- [Configure Azure VM and deploy service](https://github.com/brainfair/WeatherExporter/actions/workflows/docker.yml)
